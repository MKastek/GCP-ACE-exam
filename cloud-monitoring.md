## Cloud Monitoring  
- **Workspaces**
    - A Workspace can manage the monitoring of data for a single Google Cloud project, or it can manage the data for multiple Google Cloud projects and AWS accounts.
        - A Google Cloud project or an AWS account can only be associated with one Workspace at a time.
    - You must have the following IAM role name for the Google Cloud project to create a Workspace:
        - Monitoring Editor
        - Monitoring Admin
        - Project Owner
- **Cloud Monitoring Agent**
    - The Cloud Monitoring agent is a `collectd` based daemon that collects application and system metrics from virtual machine instances.
    - The Monitoring agent collects disk, network, CPU, and process metrics by default.
    - You can configure the Monitoring agent to monitor third-party applications.
