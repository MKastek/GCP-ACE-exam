## Cloud Storage  
- **Used for**
    - Unstructured data:  
      - Images  
      - Video  
      - Text
    - Archived data
    - Temporary storage between services
    - Global access, internet accessible
- **Logical Organization**
    - Global namespace  
    - Buckets  
    - Folders  
    - Objects

- **Bucket Configurations**
    - Life Cycle Management
        - You can define conditions that trigger data deletion, or transition to a cheaper storage class with object class with object life cycle management.
    - Versioning
        - Continue to store old copies of objects you store when they are deleted or overwritten.
    - Retention Policies
        - Define minimum retention periods that objects must be stored.
    - Object Holds
        - Place an object on hold to prevent deletion
    - Encryption Keys
        - Customer-managed
        - Customer-supplied
    - Access Permissions
        - Access Control list
        - Uniform bucket level access
        - Object and Bucket Level Permissions
- **Storage Classes:**
- **[Uploading Objects to Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uploads-downloads)**
    - Simple Upload
        - Utilize this if the file is small enough to upload again if the connection fails, and if there is **no** object metadata to send as part of the upload request.
    - Multipart Upload
        - Utilize this if the file is small enough to upload again if the connection fails, and you **need** to include object metadata as part of the upload request.
    - Resumable Upload
        - Utilize this for a more reliable transfer, which is especially important with large files.
    - [Parallel Composite Upload](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/parallel-composite-uploads)
        - Utilize if network and disk speed are not limiting factors. When doing parallel composite upload, a file is divided into up to 32 chunks and uploaded in parallel to temporary objects. The final object is recreated using the temporary objects, and the temporary objects are deleted.
    - Alternatively, for uploading large volumes of data (from hundreds of terabytes up to 1 petabyte), you can utilize **Transfer Appliance**. It is a hardware appliance you can use to securely migrate to Google Cloud Platform without disrupting business operations.
