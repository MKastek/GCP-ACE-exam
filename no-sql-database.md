## NoSQL: Datastore, Cloud Firestore and Bigtable  
NoSQL databases do not use the relational model and do ont require a fixed structure or schema. 
GCP has three NoSQL options:  
- Cloud Datastore,
- Cloud Firestore,
- Cloud Bigtable.

### Datastore
Datastore is managed database, datastore automatically partitions data and scales up or down as demand. Datastore is used for nananalytical, nonrelational storage needs. 
Datastore supports indexes and transactions. Datastore does not require a fixed schema or structure and does not support relational operation like JOINS.  

Record in Datastore is called Entity which is set of key-value pairs.  
```bash
{
book: "ACE",
chapter: 11,
length: 20,
topic: "storage"
}
```

```bash
{
book: "ACE",
chapter: 11,
length: 20,
number_of_figures: 8
}
```
`Namespace` is like schema in relational database    
`Kind` is analogous to a table in relational database  
Each entity requires a `key` which can be an autogenerated numeric key or a custom-defined key.  

After creating entites you can query the document database using `GQL`.
