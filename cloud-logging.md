## Cloud Logging  
- **Features**
    - Write any custom log, from any source, into Cloud Logging using the public write APIs.
    - Integrates with Cloud Monitoring to set alerts on the logs events and logs-based metrics you have defined.
    - You can export data in real-time to BigQuery to perform advanced analytics and SQL-like query tasks.
    - Cloud Logging helps you see the problems with your data using Error Reporting. It helps you automatically analyze your logs for exceptions and intelligently aggregate them into meaningful error groups.
- **Cloud Audit Logs**
    - Admin Activity admin logs
        - Contains log entries for API calls or other administrative actions that modify the configuration or metadata or resources.
        - You must have the IAM role logging/logs.viewer or project/viewer to view these logs.
        - Admin Activity logs are always written and you can’t configure or disable them in any way.
    - Data Access audit logs
        - Contains API calls that read the configuration or metadata of resources, including user-driven API calls that create, modify, or read user-provided resource data.
        - You must have logging/private.logs.viewer or project/owner to view these logs.
        - You must explicitly enable Data Access audit logs to be written. They are disabled by default because they are large.
    - System Event audit logs
        - Contains log entries for administrative actions taken by Google Cloud that modify the configuration of resources.
        - You must have the IAM role logging/logs.viewer or project/viewer to view these logs.
        - System Event audit logs are always written so you can’t configure or disable them.
        - There is no additional charge for your System Event audit logs.
    - Exporting Audit Logs
        - Log entries received by Logging can be exported to Cloud Storage buckets, BigQuery datasets. and Pub/Sub topics.
        - To export audit log entries outside of logging:
            - Create a logs sink.
            - Give the sink a query that specifies the audit log types you want to export.
        - If you want to export audit log entries for a Google Cloud organization, folder, or billing account, review Aggregated sinks.
